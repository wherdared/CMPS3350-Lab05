# Wordle - Mini Project

This is our mini project based on the game Wordle. This is a word guessing game where the user will have 6 tries to guess a 5-letter target word that is randomly chosen by the system. As you make your attempts to guess the target word, the system will provide hints that will help you get a better chance of guessing your target word.

## Motivation

Our goal in this project was to be able to implement the 5-letter word guessing game into a Linux terminal, where you could play the game with extra features such as a menu system where you can navigate to choose a game mode, view the rules of the game, and the option to play the game again or to exit the game. We also wanted to give a visually appealing experience by adding animations to the game.
